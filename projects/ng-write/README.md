## Installation

Add the package to your angular project using

```bash
npm install ng-write
```

## The Editor

Make sure to have the `DocuEditorModule` imported. 

```typescript
@NgModule({
  imports: [ DocuEditorModule ]
})
export class ApplicationModule {}
```

The module provides a complete form with live rendering. It should integrate with your **@angular/material** configuration. In the template simply use the editor tag to create a complete form for the article.

```html
<docu-editor (save)="saveDoc($event)"></docu-editor>
```

In the component you can define a function to handle the `save` event. For example like:

```typescript
@Component({...})
export class AppComponent {
  doc: Documentation;

  saveDoc(doc: Documentation) {
    this.doc = doc;
  }
}
```

You addition to that you can also define a `documentation` input data binding to the `docu-editor` tag to patch the documentation form.

- `@Output() save($event)`: When the user saves the form, the save event will emit and contain the complete nested form.
- `@Input() documentation: Documentation`: The user can patch the form with a previously created documentation.

## The Article

Make sure to import the `DocuModule`.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  imports: [ DocuModule ]
})
export class ApplicationModule {}
```

Then you can use the following tag to display the documentation

```html
<docu-article [documentation]="doc"></docu-article>
```

- `@Input() documentation: Documentation` interface.
